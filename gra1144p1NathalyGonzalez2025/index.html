<h3>Steps</h3>

<h4>Custard</h4>

<ol>
<li>Combine the milk powder, cornstarch, milk, eggs and sugar together in a bowl and whisk to combine</li>
<li>Pour the custard base into a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk continuously until the mixture begins to thicken</li>
	<li>Using a rubber spatula continue to mix the custard until it thickens enough to form a ball</li>
<li>Remove from the heat and add the butter</li>
<li>Mix the custard until the butter is fully incorporated</li>
<li>Wrap the custard in clingwrap and place it in the fridge to cool completely</li>
	<li>Meanwhile prepare the snowskin</li>
	</ol>
<h4>Snow Skin</h4>

<ol>
<li>Combine the rice flours, wheat/corn starch, white sugar and milk, whisk together until smooth</li>
<li>Cover the mixture and steam for 20 minutes, or until the centre is fully set</li>
<li>Remove from the heat and add the oil</li>
<li>Roughly mix the mixture and allow it to cool completely</li>
<li>Using your hands knead the dough until the oil is completely absorbed</li>
<li>Remove one-third of the dough and knead in your desired colouring/flavouring, I used freeze-dried raspberry powder but you can use food colouring</li>
<li>Divide the white dough and pink dough into 5 equal parts</li>
<li>Combine the pink and white dough together to form 5 balls and set aside</li>
</ol>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<ol>
<li>Once the custard has cooled divide it into 5 equal portions (each should weight ~50g)</li>
<li>Wrap a whole strawberry in each portion and form into a balls</li>
<li>Lightly coat a ball of snowskin in cornstarch and dust the mooncake mould (I used a 100g mould)</li>
<li>Flatten the ball and roll it out with a rolling pin to form a circle</li>
<li>Place a ball of custard in the centre and pull the sides of the snowskin in to enclose the custard</li>
<li>Smoothen the surface of the dough and shape it into a mooncake using the dusted mould</li>
<li>Repeat with the remaining custard and dough</li>
<li>Refrigerate for 1-2 hours to set before serving</li>
</ol>
