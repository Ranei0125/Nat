	<p>Snow skin mooncakes are more of a modern take on the classic mooncake. There is no baking required and the skin is a soft mochi-like consistency. The filling can range from bean pastes and custards to cheesecake and ice cream!</p><section><h3>Ingredients</h3><h4>Snow Skin</h4><ul>

	</ul></section><section><h3>Steps</h3><h4>Custard</h4><ol>
	<li>Combine the milk powder, cornstarch, milk, eggs and sugar together in a bowl and whisk to combine</li>
	<li>Pour the custard base into a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk continuously until the mixture begins to thicken</li>
	<li>Using a rubber spatula continue to mix the custard until it thickens enough to form a ball</li>
	<li>Remove from the heat and add the butter</li>
	<li>Mix the custard until the butter is fully incorporated</li>
	<li>Wrap the custard in clingwrap and place it in the fridge to cool completely</li>
	<li>Meanwhile prepare the snowskin</li></ol>
	<h4>Snow Skin</h4><ol>
	<li>Combine the rice flours, wheat/corn starch, white sugar and milk, whisk together until smooth</li>
	<li>Cover the mixture and steam for 20 minutes, or until the centre is fully set</li>
	<li>Remove from the heat and add the oil</li>
	<li>Roughly mix the mixture and allow it to cool completely</li>
	<li>Using your hands knead the dough until the oil is completely absorbed</li><li>Remove one-third of the dough and knead in your desired colouring/flavouring, I used freeze-dried raspberry powder but you can use food colouring</li>
	<li>Divide the white dough and pink dough into 5 equal parts</li>
	<li>Combine the pink and white dough together to form 5 balls and set aside</li></ol>
	<h4>Assembly</h4><ol><li>Once the custard has cooled divide it into 5 equal portions (each should weight ~50g) </li>
	<li>Wrap a whole strawberry in each portion and form into a balls</li>
	<li>Lightly coat a ball of snowskin in cornstarch and dust the mooncake mould (I used a 100g mould)</li>
	<li>Flatten the ball and roll it out with a rolling pin to form a circle</li>
	<li>Place a ball of custard in the centre and pull the sides of the snowskin in to enclose the custard</li>
	<li>Smoothen the surface of the dough and shape it into a mooncake using the dusted mould </li>
	<li>Repeat with the remaining custard and dough</li>
	<li>Refrigerate for 1-2 hours to set before serving</li></ol>
